This is a simple exercise that allowed me to understand 2 dimensional arrays

This was meant to be a simple exercise that allowed me to see how 2d arrays were able to work with looping through the arrays to create a model of the movement used by the PacMan game.

The only thing you need to get started is a text editor.

Future updates to this project will allow the PacMan image to move up and down the Y-axis making the images move around the entire perimeter. 

StackOverflow and youtube were a big help with assisting me.
