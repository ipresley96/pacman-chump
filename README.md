This is a simple exercise that allowed me to understand 2-dimensional arrays

This was meant to be a simple exercise that allowed me to see how 2d arrays were able to work with looping through the arrays to create a model of the movement used by the PacMan game.

Download the files from this repository.

Future updates to this project will allow the PacMan image to move up and down the Y-axis making the images move around the entire perimeter. 

This project made use of the setTimeout function and DOM manipulation.

StackOverflow, Youtube and MDN were all a big help with assisting.
